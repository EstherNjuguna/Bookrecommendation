Book recommendation
Building a webpage for viewing and editing Js books. Will be using a local API and building out the frontend for our app.
 It is an HTML, CSS and JavaScript project that communicates with a public API to store users. It is user friendly and it is easy to navigate arround while on it. It works well with all the pages functioning.

Setup
Run this command to get the backend started:

$ json-server --watch db.json
Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

http://localhost:3000/books

Then, open the index.html file on your browser to run the application.

The API source code is https://blooming-lake-11486.herokuapp.com/books

Deliverables
 I can:

1. See the first book's details, including its name, image and description when the page loads.Make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the book data,
2. Able to sign up or log in to the webpage,
3. Make a GET request to the following endpoint to get the book data,
4. Leave and edit a book review.
